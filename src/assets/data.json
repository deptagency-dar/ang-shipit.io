Our first Origin Story is with Matt Merrill, Principal Software Engineer at Rocket Insights.  Matt started as a Computer Science major in college but ended up switching to a different major. Theoretical programming just wasn't interesting to him.  But, in his second year out working in the real world, found himself doing some stuff that made him realize that programming business applications was a lot different than the theoretical stuff he knew from school. It  didn't take long for Matt to fall back in love with programming and make it a career. Over the course of his roundabout journey, Matt learned a couple important lessons.

    "description" : "Rocket developers Brandon Aaskov, Dave Oelfke, Simon Ingeson, and Matt Merrill dive into the topic of clean code. When is it worth it? When is it unnecessary? Will it get you in trouble with your teammates? We also share some practical tips for walking the line between \"You ain't gonna need it\" and when it's worth it to spend that extra 20 minutes cleaning up code.  This podcast was inspired by the article \"Goodbye Clean Code\" by Dan Abramov which ignited a lot of talk in the Rocket Insights engineering slack channels! Detailed Notes: 00:00 - Intros 03:20 - Human readability is the most important thing. Are there any hard and fast rules? Cyclomatic complexity is a fancy word that's discussed 06:00 - It's hard to break out of a bad abstraction. It's hard to predict the future 11:00 - There's nothing more permanent than temporary 12:15 - Spreading out your code over lots of folders is probably not a great idea 14:30 - Flexing your muscles... Unnecessarily? 15:26 - A word from our sponsor 16:30 - Wait for the pain 19:30 - Give yourself flexibility for the future, but don't implement it right away 20:40 - How did we get to this point? A little history. Memory management wasn't always done for us 27:00 - There are no hard and fast rules. Be an adult 29:45 - The golden hour rule. Readme's are important 37:45 - Back to what makes code readable 41:00 - Testability.

When is it worth it? When is it unnecessary? Will it get you in trouble with your teammates? We also share some practical tips for walking the line between &#34;You ain&#39;t gonna need it&#34; and when it&#39;s worth it to spend that extra 20 minutes cleaning up code.  This podcast was inspired by the article <a href=\"https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#34;Goodbye Clean Code&#34; by Dan Abramov</a> which ignited a lot of talk in the Rocket Insights engineering slack channels!</p><br/><p>Detailed Notes:</p><br/><ul><li>00:00 - Intros</li><li>03:20 - Human readability is the most important thing. Are there any hard and fast rules? Cyclomatic complexity is a fancy word that&#39;s discussed</li><li>06:00 - It&#39;s hard to break out of a bad abstraction. It&#39;s hard to predict the future</li><li>11:00 - There&#39;s nothing more permanent than temporary</li><li>12:15 - Spreading out your code over lots of folders is probably not a great idea</li><li>14:30 - Flexing your muscles... Unnecessarily?</li><li>15:26 - A word from our sponsor</li><li>16:30 - Wait for the pain</li><li>19:30 - Give yourself flexibility for the future, but don&#39;t implement it right away</li><li>20:40 - How did we get to this point?

Topics:  0:00 - Intros and a brief history of Redux.  Opinions abound!  Scott O'Brien - The Rocket Insights dev who (used to) troll Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) on Twitter   2:30 - What is Redux? 3:30 - GraphQL and Apollo as an alternative (or compliment) to Redux. 5:00 - When does using Redux make sense? 8:45 - Redux vs. MobX. 14:15 - Angular 1.3 two way binding, oh no! 16:45 - When should you reach for Redux? When are your components too complicated? 17:30 - Should you use React's Context instead? 18:03 - Will React Hooks do away with Redux?  Note: This episode was recorded when Hooks weren't yet available for GA release.   25:14 - Back to Apollo - Subscriptions. 26:45 - Hot takes! Don't use Redux. Use Mobx, or Vue and VueX instead. 31:30 - Hot takes! Mutability is ok. 34:45 - I just want to use things that work, not the newest fanciest thing.  37:15 - Redux on the server!? 39:45 - You can write your app in jQuery and Redux (!?) 40:45 - Picks!
